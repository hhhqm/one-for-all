Render Engine turns Schema into real UI

# What is a Schema?

Schema is the description of a web page, which not only contain the layouts and elements in it, but also business logic,
which means you can use schema to describe a single page web app.

There are some advantages of using Schema:

- It is more friendly to most users, users do not need to know react, as long as they have a basic HTML and JavaScript foundation.
- Easy to modify, the schema is json, no need to compile or bundle.
- Schema is composable, you can define a reference to another Schema.
- and Render Engine helps you to turn Schema into real UI

Can I really use schema to describe a serious web app?

Yes, you can:

- Describe the page hierarchy.
- Describe which component I want to use and how to use it.
- Describe how to make an API request.
- Describe how the component uses API results.
- Describe the communication and relationship of components.
- Describes how to render a component looped or conditionally.
- Describe routes.
- Describe the combination of serval Schemas.
